▶ [home~/]> help
  : Displays a list of all available Terminal commands, how to use them, and a description of what they do.

▶ [home~/]> Ls
  : Is a basic command that shows files on the computer. Right now, it shows that you have a program called     
    “NUKE.exe” on your computer. We’ll get to what this does later

▶ [home~/]> scan
  : Shows all available network connection. In other words, it displays a list of all servers that can be connected to from your current machine.
    A server is identified by its hostname.

▶ [home~/]> scan-analyze
  : gives some more detailed infornation about each server that you can connect to (servers that are a distance of one node away)

▶ [home~/]> scan-analyze 2
  : It is also possible to run scan-analyze with a higher depth.  
    Now we can see information about all servers that are up to two nodes away, as well as figure out how to navigate to those servers through the network. 
    You can only connect to a server that is one node away. To connect to a machine.

▶ [home~/]> connect hostname (exhostname, n00dles)
  : We can see that the n00dles server is only one node away.

▶ [home~/]> analyze
  : Before we try to hack a server, we should run diagnostics using that.
    Finishes rinning it will show useful information about hacking the server.

** For this server, the required hacking skill is only 1, which means you can hack it rihgt now. 
   However, in order to hack a server you must first gain root access. The NUKE.exe program that we saw earlier on your home computer is a vuvirus 
   that will great you root access to a nachine if there are enough open ports

▶ [n00dles~/]> analyze 
  : Shows that there do not need to be any open ports on this nachine for the NUKE.exe virus to work, so go ahead and run the virus using under JS code.

▶ [n00dles~/]> run NUKE.exe

▶ [n00dles~/]> hack
  : You are now attempting to hack the server. Performing a hack takes time and only has a certain percentage chance of success. 
    This time and success chance is determined by a variety of factors, including      your hacking skill and the server’s security level.  
    If you attempt to hack the server is successful, you will steal a certain percentage of the server’s total money. 
    This perventage is affected by your hacking skill and the server’s security level.

▶ [n00dles~/]> gorw
  : The anout of money on a server is not limitless. so, if you constantly hack a server and deplete its money,      
    then you will encounter diminishing returns in tour hacking. You will need to use under JS code.

▶ [n00dles~/]> weaken
  : Which tricks the company into adding money to their server and which invreases the speed of hack and        grow


** From any server you can get back home using
▶ [n00dles~/]> home

To create a new script or edit an existing one, you can use.
▶ [home~/]> nano n00dles.script
(*Scripts must end with the “.script“ extension. )

This is the script editor. You can use it to program your scripts. Scripts are written in a simplified version of Javascript. 
Copy and paste the following code into the script editor.
(*To save and close the script editor, press the button in the bottom left or press ctrl+s then ctrl+b

▶ "while(true) {
    hack('n00dles');
    }“
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now we'll run the script. Scripts require a certain amount of RAM to run, 
and can be run on any machine which you have root access to. Different servers have different amounts of RAM. 
You can also purchase more RAM for your home server.
To check how much RAM is available on this machine, enter

▶ [home~/]> free

▶ [home~/]> run n00dles.script

Your script is now running! It will continuously run in the background and will automatically stop if the code ever completes 
(the n00dles.script will never complete because it runs an infinite loop).
These scripts can passively earn you income and hacking experience. 
Your scripts will also earn money and experience while you are offline, although at a slightly slower rate.

One last thing about scripts, each active script contains logs that detail what it's doing. 
We can check these logs using the tail command. Do that now for the script we just ran by typing
▶ [home~/]> tail n00dles.script
